The advantage of notebooks is that they can include explanatory text, code, and plots in the same document.\n\n**This makes of notebooks an ideal playground for explaining and learning new things without having to jump between several documents. Thanks to binder, you can run them in your web browser without requiring to install anything!**\n\nThis document itself is a notebook. It is a simple text file with a `.ipynb` file path ending. If you opened this notebook via an OGGM-Edu Binder link, it is opened in a platform which is called [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). \"JupyterLab\" is the development environment allowing you to navigate between notebooks (navigation bar on the left), (re-)start them, and much more.

You can **insert** cells in a notebook with the `+` button in the toolbar. Again, it is much faster to learn the keybord shortcut for this: `[Ctrl+m]` or `[ESC]` to enter in command mode (blue frame) then press `[a]` to insert a cell \"above\" the active cell or `[b]` for \"below\".\n\nCreate a few empty cells above and below the current one and try to create some variables.
